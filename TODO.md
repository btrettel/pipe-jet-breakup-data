# TODO

- Update to Python 3
- Convert variable names to be consistent with papers (e.g., L_b ==> x_b, I_0 ==> Tubar_0, v_d_bar ==> vdavg)
- Change regime names to be consistent with papers and not archaic
- Add more data validation checks (see section below)
- Add type hinting (both function and variable annotation, with latest syntax). Some links:

  - https://www.bernat.tech/the-state-of-type-hints-in-python/
  - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32557920/what-are-type-hints-in-python-3-5
- Make many loops use zip rather than indexing
- Add data and script for pipe turbulence statistics
- Use one file for each study to make editing the code easier.
- "codebook" per http://datacolada.org/69
- standardized input CSV file form?
- Have Gnumeric spreadsheets for every CSV file, and use [data validation](http://www.fifi.org/doc/gnumeric-doc/html/C/protectionandvalidation.html) in the spreadsheets
- Change x_low, etc. to x_s_low as this is actually x_low/d_0.
- Regression considering uncertainty.
- Bayesian experimental design
- Bayesian model selection
- Add more citations listed in the "Data sources to add" section below to the bib file. Stopped at kitamura_influence_1978.
- https://liw.fi/hackingdoc/
- https://liw.fi/free-software-website/
- https://vincent.bernat.ch/en/blog/2019-sustainable-python-script
- Test all functions used. Start with assertions on all inputs and outputs (test bounds and dimensions), [Hypothesis for property testing](https://datascience.blog.wzb.eu/2019/11/08/property-based-testing-for-scientific-code-in-python/) and [doctest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctest).
- [Require keyword arguments](http://www.jefftk.com/p/require-keyword-arguments)
- Start using Pylint regularly.
- Use AIC in addition to R^2 in model comparisons.
- Add transcription error to all data
- Better development length equations:
    - laminar: durst_development_2005, check others in same directory

# Data sources to add

- Add photos from trettel_turbulent_2020.
- Obtain more data for liquid-liquid systems, liquid jets in cross flow, liquid jets with co-flows
- Get more spray angles from photos.
- Add more data from Phinney for various atmospheric densities. (Not sure what I meant by this. I'll check if all of Phinney's data has been added.)
- Re-add data from wu_liquid_1992. Type raw data in and process to produce the Weber number, e.g., table B.5 has velocities not entered in the spreadsheet. Compare this against the one in there right now, which I believe was produced from figures? Also check that the Weber and Reynolds numbers are actually higher than 1e6 as this is the only data I have that high.
- Add missing xiavg, D, etc. data from Sallam
- TODO: Add single-phase jet data, say We = \infty

- smith_experiments_1917/tyler_characteristic_1924/tyler_experiments_1932/tyler_instability_1933 (I guess these all use pipe nozzles. The breakup length might not correspond precisely to the definition I use, but should be useful to determine the breakup length regime. The mercury data is fairly unique and could indicate there's a different regime for laminar jets at low We but relatively high Re. This would also imply that the downstream transition regime extends to much lower Weber numbers than I expected.)

## Cavitation data

- TODO: Find more.
- TODO: Search for cavitation in submerged jet nozzles.

    - pearce_discharge_1971 p. D2-19 mentions some issues.

- nurick_orifice_1976: L/d = 20
- reitz_atomization_1978 (e.g., p. 230 suggests K_crit is not defined for long tubes)
    - also see reitz_dependence_1979
- ruff_structure_1990 p. 11: > no evidence of cavitation within the passage was observed
- woodward_primary_1993 p. 81-: suggests cavitation might be occurring; pp. 89-90 discusses the critical cavitation number; also discusses on p. 93 how the smoothed out inlet reduces the probability of cavitation; p. 39: L/d = 21.3 for injector B, and arguably L/d = 50 for injector B
- ramamurthi_characteristics_1999
- ahn_effects_2006: Cavitation is visible at L_0/d_0 = 20 in fig. 2.

# Data validation

- if known liquid, check that provided fluid properties are near what is expected
- Can K_c be negative?
- Reject all laminar data that isn't fully developed.
- Require increasing variables like pressure, velocity, Reynolds number, Weber number, etc. in each series. Do this for certain series, resetting when a new series is encountered?
- Double check all bounds on quantities in case you missed a bound.

# Database fields

- DONE: Add motion compensation key for photos. thorne_effect_1978, taylor_water_1983 (I later read that Hoyt and Taylor had two different setups with different methods of motion compensation?)
- Add field to mark as true when data for the wrong fluid was used due to the correct data being unavailable or otherwise.
- Add duration of jet in time.
- DONE: Add Jakob number for flashing. See Incropera p. 376, kitamura_critical_1986, cleary_flashing_2007. Alternative: how close the temperature is to boiling. nezgada_effect_1970, nezgada_effect_1970-1. siebers_scaling_1999 eq. 7 is another approach. Vapor pressure / ambient pressure is another approach (which is similar to the cavitation number...).
- Check whether spray angles are for the near or far fields.
- Characterize velocity profile. logan_flow_1963
- Add index of refraction. corey_droplet_1969 pdf p. 37, balewski_experimental_2008
- MAYBE: Add information about cavitation inception. History of water? keller_influence_1980, ooi_scale_1985 (dissolved air content in ppm), brennen_cavitation_2013 p. 22
- MAYBE: Add distance to flat plate divided by nozzle diameter for breakup measurements. See takahashi_stability_1972 p. 75. li_study_2007 seems to be on the same topic, but I don't know if they come to the same conclusion.
